# Concept in NLP

## Concept

### One-hot vector

### Word Embedding

### Perplexity

### Temperature


## Model Card

### RNN: Recurrent Neural Networks

### Bi-directional RNNs

### GRU: Gated Recurrent Units

### LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory

### Attention
> **Context Vector** is an expected value

### Transformer


## Metric

### F1 score

### BLEU: Bilingual Evaluation Understudy
> The closer to 1, the better

### ROUGE: Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation


## Sampling and Decoding:

### Random sampling

### Temperature in sampling

### Greedy Decoding
 **Lower temperature setting:** More confident, conservative network \
 **Higher temperature setting:** More excited, random network

### Beam Search
Problem:
> 1. Penalizes long sequences, so you should normalize by the sentence length
> 2. Computationally expensive and consumes a lot of memory
